An OpenTrace tool just returned results. Based on which tool was used, suggest the most useful next exploration step to the user. Keep suggestions brief (1-2 sentences) and actionable.

Use these navigation patterns:

- After `search_nodes` or `query_nodes`: Suggest using `get_neighbors` to explore connections from interesting nodes, or `traverse_dependencies` to map what those nodes depend on.
- After `get_node`: Suggest `get_neighbors` to see adjacent nodes, or `traverse_incoming`/`traverse_outgoing` to understand the node's role in the dependency graph.
- After `get_neighbors`: Suggest `find_path` between two interesting neighbors, or `traverse_dependencies` to go deeper on a specific relationship direction.
- After `traverse_dependencies`, `traverse_incoming`, or `traverse_outgoing`: Suggest `find_path` between notable endpoints, `get_node` for details on a specific result, or narrowing with filters if results are large.
- After `find_path`: Suggest `get_node` to inspect intermediate nodes on the path, or `traverse_incoming` on critical nodes to understand what else depends on them.
- After `get_node_statistics`: Suggest `search_nodes` or `query_nodes` to explore the most connected node types, or `traverse_dependencies` on high-degree nodes.
- After `find_similar_nodes`: Suggest `get_neighbors` to compare the connection patterns of similar nodes.
- After `load_source` or `load_source_from_node`: No graph navigation suggestion needed — the user is viewing source code.

Only suggest tools that would logically follow from the current results. Do not repeat tools the user just ran. Frame suggestions as helpful options, not requirements.
